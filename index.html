                 Also! i know you don't really like the idea of getting older, so i wanted to write some reasons why it'll be ok!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content"  id="step2">
                <img src="img.jpg" alt="...image" id="image" class="mc-img live">
                <h3>
                   The feeling of being behind & a disappointment
                </h3>
                <p> I know you don't like the idea of getting older, i don't either, but! i just wanna remind you that you're still on good pace in life, it might seem slow, however, thats because people are too harsh on you and you have a lot of pressure. You are not a disappointment and like i've said before, im very proud of you and i do feel like you've had growth as a person since i met you, which is great! I just hope you let down on comparing yourself to others, the majority of people feel like us, it'll be ok!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content"  id="step3">

                <img src="img.jpg" alt="...image" id="image" class="mc-img live">
                <h3>
                    Arbitrarily "losing value" 
                </h3>
                <p> i know another reason you don't like the idea of getting older is because of the stigma that "women lose value when they get older!" and what i wanna say in regards to that is maybe if the only value you see a women as is a breeding machine, maybe you could argue it, but for me and any normal person its simply not true.  You're a very good and caring person with so much value, as a partner, friend and more, and in my eyes you'll always be the most valuable. You're so sweet, beautiful, kind, understanding and you are a great listener too ❤️  and all those things will apply at any age. you're just a great person and it makes me happy somebody like you can receive all my love and affection
                     <hr>
                     <br>

                     So, yeah. Happy Birthday again, I'll be happy to be around for the 24th too! It's been great being your friend and I really hope this makes you smile, you have a beautiful smile.
